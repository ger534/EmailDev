            One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
            himself
            transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a
            little he could see his
            brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to
            cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
